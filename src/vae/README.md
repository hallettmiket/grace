This is primarily R/Keras code to build and run the Variational Autoencoder for the data.

The training of the VAE uses the bounding boxes of the train and validation sets. The python script vae.py generates these subimages.

Note that since our curriculum learning set is cummulative, we just need to iterate through the images listed in train_hyphae.pkl and val_hyphae.pkl (hyphae is the final grade).

You will have to struggle with installing keras in R with GPUs, but note that CPUs are much easier to get working and probably suffice for our simple examples here.
