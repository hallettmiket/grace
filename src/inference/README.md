If you want to try out our classifier, you've come to the right place! The Jupyter notebook `tutorial.ipynb` walks through a simple case of running our model over a user specifed test image.  All the classes and functions in `tutorial.ipynb` are called from `utils.py`.  They consist primarily of wrappers of various mmdetection modules.

This is should be enough to get you started.  Over time we'll add more tutorial notebooks to cover more advanced uses of our model (eg: fancy interpretability techniques).
