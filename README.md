Candescence - Software to capture the essence of Candida albicans morphologies. :microscope: :crystal_ball:



This is an effort of the [Hallett lab](https://mikehallett.science). The full project is described at our [OSF Candescence](https://osf.io/qdxbp/) repository.

This project is described in our bioRxiv manuscript Bettauer et al. (2021) bioRxiv #445299.

This repository houses the code for building the Candescence object-detection/object-classification classifiers, the VAE and the GANs. 

The underlying learning set (entitled Varasana), presentations, figures, bibiography etc are available at the [OSF site](https://osf.io/qdxbp/).

In high level terms, you will need the following. 

-- Python 3.7; R 3.6  and many libraries for each. 
-- You will need PyTorch and torchvision. The VAE is written in Keras/R.
-- [MMDETECTION](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and Open-MMLab

You need to download several datafiles including the Varasana learning set of images and the models (pth file) for the FCOS and the GAN. 

While we wait for the EBI BioImage repository to accept our data, download all the Candecence data fro here: [temporary site](http://csfg-algonquin.concordia.ca/~hallett/candescence/)

You will have to define effectively four paths that are referred to throughout our code:

CANDESCENCE: this points to the root of the directories downloaded. <br>
VARASANA: this points to the Varasana dataset within CANDESCENCE. That is. VARSANA = CANDESCENCE + "/varasana" <br>
ROOT: the file path to this repo on your machine<br>
OUTPUT: which is usually a subfolder of CANDESCENCE. e.g. CANDESCENCE + "/output" ... This stores all the data generated by an MMDECTION  run.<br>
PERFORMANCE: This stores all the generated analyses of the performance of the classifier described in OUTPUT. Usually defined as CANDESCENCE + "/performance"<br>
TOOL: this points to the MMDETECTION executable.<br>
VAES: this points to all of the Variational AutoEncoder models and output.
