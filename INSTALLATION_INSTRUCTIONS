You will need to download and install MMDETECTION. You will also need Python and R. We used version 3.7 and 3.6 repectively for version 1.0 of this project.

Then, to setup the python environment to run python scripts and notebooks in this repository run:
`conda env create -f environment.yml`

Activate the new environment with the command `conda activate candescence`

Finally run `pip install -v -e $TOOL_BIN/mmdetection`

(Note on our server, we installed this in $TOOL_bin=/home/data/analysis-tools.)

If the install fails, please try the following steps below.

1. Create a conda virtual environment and activate it.

`conda create -n open-mmlab python=3.7 -y`
`conda activate open-mmlab`

2. Install PyTorch and torchvision,

`conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch`

3. Install mmcv-full

`pip install mmcv-full -f https://download.openmmlab.com/mmcv/dist/cu102/torch1.7.0/index.html`

4.Install build requirements and then install MMDetection.

`git clone https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection.git`
`cd mmdetection`
`pip install -r requirements/build.txt`
`pip install -v -e .`

5. Install scikit-image
`conda install -c conda-forge scikit-image`

6. You need to declare the datasets in MMDET. This is done with the file called candida_dataset.py available as part of this repository in folder mmdetection_datasets.
This file needs to go into $TOOLS/mmdetection/mmdet/datasets, where $TOOLS is your install location for mmdetection.
